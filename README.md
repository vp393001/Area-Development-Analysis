# Proposed Title

Analyzing the growth of rural and urban areas using temporal data from OpenStreetMap.

# Abstract
 
The role of rural and urban planning and management is becoming more and more crucial due to the dramatic increase in population and allied urban problems. Our government is using applications such as GDSS (Geospatial Decision Support Systems), GIS (Geospatial information system) to keep track of the growth of rural and urban development. The government faces difficulties when it comes to tracking development done in a particular region over the past couple of years. The government spends a certain amount of money on development and they need to make sure that it is being utilized properly. The government also needs to find out remote areas and the best possible way to connect it with the rest of the world through transportation facility. Open data. Free. how that can be used for benefit of the above things that you are talking about. Thus we decided to simplify the process using technology through this project which will help government entities to plan development strategies more efficiently.


# Introduction to the project

Rular and Urban areas grow in area and population every day, calling for more resources, better living spaces and improved administration. Thus we decided to analyze the growth of urban and rural areas. This project can be used by various government organizations to see the development done in a specific region in the past few years. This way government entity can keep track of development done and take necessary steps if required. 

This project uses a temporal dataset of Open Street Map of a specific geographical region that contains geographical data of that particular region taken over a span of a long period and at different time intervals. The project will help us to generate insightful results from the huge dataset. Government entities will also be able to visualize the difference in the development of roads over the span of a few years. Various filters can be applied to the processed data according to the requirement and results can be narrowed down. 


# Objectives of the work

The objective of this project is to generate a graphical representation of development in rural and urban areas by analyzing the already available dataset. This analysis can be further used to take critical actions by the government for the development of urban and rural areas.
